#Introduction to HTML and CSS

This section will teach me the basics of HTML and CSS, the two foundational building blocks of pretty much everything on the web.

## HTML and CSS

**HTML** and **CSS** are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when **look** at something oht the internet.

- **HTML** is the raw data that a webpage is built out of.
    - Text
    - Links
    - Cards
    - Lists
    - Buttons
    - .....

- **CSS** is what add style to those plain elemnets.

**HTML** puts information on a webpage, and **CSS** position that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!.
