# Introduction to HTML and CSS

This section will teach me the basics of HTML and CSS, the two foundational building blocks of almost everything on the web.

## HTML and CSS

**HTML** and **CSS** are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when **look** at something on the internet.

- **HTML** is the raw data that a webpage is built out of.
    - Text
    - Links
    - Cards
    - Lists
    - Buttons
    - .....

- **CSS** is what adds style to those plain elements.

**HTML** puts information on a webpage, and **CSS** positions that information gives it the color, changes the font, and makes it look great!

## Elements and Tags

Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.

A full paragraph element looks like this:

~~```html

    <p> some text content </p>

```

> You can think of elements as conainers for content.

HTML has a ***vast list of predefined tags***
